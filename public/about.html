<p>
  I always wanted to learn Web Design but i didn't have right opportunity. Now,
  I am a student of the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by
  Dr. Angela Yu. I'm very motivated and I enjoy the process. It feels great to
  see knowledge in the act. More I learn, projects are getting more functional,
  more content and better looking. As the time passes, this page will look much
  better.
